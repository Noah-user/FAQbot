question,answer
What is AI?,"AI stands for Artificial Intelligence, which involves creating systems that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence."
What is GPT-2?,GPT-2 is a large transformer-based language model developed by OpenAI.
How does machine learning work?,Machine learning involves training algorithms to recognize patterns in data and make predictions or decisions.
What is the difference between AI and ML?,"AI is a broader concept of machines capable of performing tasks, while ML is a subset focused on learning from data."
What is transfer learning?,"Transfer learning involves leveraging pre-trained models for new tasks, saving time and resources."
What are neural networks?,"Neural networks are algorithms inspired by the structure of the human brain, used for tasks like classification and regression."
How do I fine-tune GPT-2?,Fine-tuning GPT-2 involves training it on a smaller dataset specific to a task while retaining its pre-trained knowledge.
What is the role of data in AI?,"Data is the backbone of AI, providing the information needed to train models and make predictions."
What are the types of machine learning?,"The types of machine learning include supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning."
What is overfitting in ML?,"Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, failing to generalize to new data."
